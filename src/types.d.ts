// It's better to use enum instead of export type, because it can be used in utils for type checking.
// export type MockParameter = "mock1" | "mock2" | "mock3" | "mock4" | "mock5";

/* As long as there is no need for enums in the types file it can be called types.d.ts because it's a definition file.Â´
*  The issue with the enums is that they can be used during runtime so they are transpiled to JavaScript.
*  If you insist on having the enums here, you must change the filename to types.ts and export the enums as const.
